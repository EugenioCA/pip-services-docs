    This package contains interfaces and classes that can be used to implement various remote procedure calls (RPCs). In it, RPCs replace unique calls with universal "message transfer" calls, in which the message itself contains the called method's signature, as well as the parameters to pass for its execution.    
    
    This package allows you to create [Commandable Interfaces](icommandable), which are completely universal. Thus, for example, if an object extends [ICommandable](icommandable) and returns a [CommandSet](command_set), then you can implement a commandable client for this object, using various technologies and with minimal code.    
    
    The package main components are:    
    
    - [Commandable Interfaces](icommandable) â€“ used to make classes with a certain logic and, which are capable of receiving and processing commands in this universal form.

### Interfaces

#### [ICommandInterceptor](icommand_interceptor)
Implements a [command](icommand) wrapped by an interceptor.
It allows to build command call chains. The interceptor can alter execution
and delegate calls to a next command, which can be intercepted or concrete.

#### [ICommand](icommand)
An interface for Commands, which are part of the Command design pattern. Each command wraps a method or function and allows 
to call them in uniform and safe manner.

#### [ICommandable](icommandable)
An interface for commandable objects, which are part of the command design pattern.
The commandable object exposes its functonality as commands and events groupped
into a [CommandSet](command_set).
This interface is typically implemented by controllers and is used to auto generate
external interfaces.

#### [IEventListener](ievent_listener)
An interface for listener objects that receive notifications on fired events.

#### [IEvent](ievent)
An interface for Events, which are part of the Command design pattern.
Events allows to send asynchronious notifications to multiple subscribed listeners.

### Classes

#### [CommandSet](command_set)
Contains a set of commands and events supported by a [commandable](icommandable) object.
The CommandSet supports command interceptors to extend and the command call chain.   
CommandSets can be used as alternative commandable interface to a business object.
It can be used to auto generate multiple external services for the business object
without writing much code.

#### [Command](command)
Concrete implementation of [ICommand](icommand) interface. Command allows to call a method
or function using Command pattern.

#### [Event](event)
Concrete implementation of [IEvent](ievent) interface.
It allows to send asynchronous notifications to multiple subscribed listeners.
