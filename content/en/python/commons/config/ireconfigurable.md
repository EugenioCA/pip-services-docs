### Description
The IReconfigurable interface is used to set configuration parameters to an object.

Important points:

- It is similar to [IConfigurable](../iconfigurable) interface, but emphasises the fact that **configure()** method can be called more than once to change object configuration in runtime.  

**Implements:** [IConfigurable](../iconfigurable)
