Before we can start writing-up some microservices, we’ll need to install a few mandatory prerequisites.

### 1. Compiler and IDE

First and foremost - we’ll need a compiler for your programming language of choice, as well as some sort of code editor. In our examples, we usually use Visual Studio Code, but any fitting IDE will do.

For working with the Python programming language, you’ll need to perform its installation and setup the environment. To do this, download and install Python from their [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) . Select the download that corresponds to the operating system you’re using, and follow the installation instructions listed on their site.

Once installed, check that the installation was completed successfully by running the following command from your console:

```bash
python --version
```
