### [Data Microservice](data_microservice)

In this tutorial, we’ll be writing from scratch a fully-functional Data microservice, using the patterns and mechanisms available in the Pip.Services toolkit, as well as the programming language you have selected. The microservice that we are going to be using as an example in this tutorial is called The Beacons microservice, which is part of The IoT Microservices Collection.

Knowing how to create a client library for your microservice is almost as important as knowing how to create the microservice itself. Some people question whether or not client libraries are actually necessary, and say that it’s enough to just describe the external interface and let the users of the microservice implement their own interaction protocol.
