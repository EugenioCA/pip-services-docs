### Key takeaways

### Introduction

This tutorial will teach you how to create factories for custom and built-in components. For this, we will first understand the IFactory interface and its relations with the Factory and CompositeFactory components. Then, we will learn how to create a factory that helps build custom and existing components and how to use default factories. Next, we will see how to create a composite factory that groups several factories together. Finally, we will review all the concepts learned.
