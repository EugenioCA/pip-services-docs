### [Client Library](client_library)

This tutorial explains how to create a client library in five easy-to-follow steps. In addition, it explains why client libraries are important and provides some advice for the development of client libraries.


### [Data Microservice](data_microservice)

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll be writing from scratch a fully-functional Data microservice, using the patterns and mechanisms available in the Pip.Services toolkit, as well as the programming language you have selected. The microservice that we are going to be using as an example in this tutorial is called The Beacons microservice, which is part of The IoT Microservices Collection.


### [Microservice Dockerization](microservice_dockerization)

Running microservices in Docker containers has become one of the most popular ways of deploying a system. Based on this, this tutorial explains how to create and run a dockerized microservice in five well-defined steps.


### [Microservice Facade](microservice_facade)

In this tutorial, we will be taking a look at how to implement a simple facade that will provide a versioned external API for the microservice implemented in [the Data Microservice](data_microservice) tutorial. Additionally, our facade will implement client authentication and authorization using microservices from the Pip.Services Library.
