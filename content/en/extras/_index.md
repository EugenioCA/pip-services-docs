### [Benchmarking Framework](benchmarks)
Performance, resilience and data integrity are a priority in microservice development. To make your life easier, we implemented a benchmarking framework to keep critical non-functional characteristics under constant control.  In a similar vein with Pip.Service Toolkit, the framework has symmetrical implementations to make it easier to switch between programming languages.


### [Templates](templates)
To get you started faster, we developed a number of microservice templates in all of the supported languages. They include every essential component, support versioning, and instrumentation. Additionally, you can find templates to script development and production environments and automate microservice CI/CD pipelines. These templates are a great starting point to create your own templates to achieve consistency and spread the best practices across your entire organization.


### [Selenium WebDriver module for PowerShell](ps_selenium)
Our team uses Powershell for system testing and automation. Selenium is a popular testing framework for web applications. It supports many programming languages, except for Powershell. So, we decided to implement our own PowerShell driver for Selenium and share it with you.
