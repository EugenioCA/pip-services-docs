So, letâ€™s start developing microservices using the Pip.Services toolkit. As a simple example, we will make a Hello World microservice, which will greet you in response to your request. The communication protocol will be HTTP REST.

The microservice is structurally made up of these components:

- The controller, which generates responses to requests
- A REST service for the transmission of responses and requests
- The component factory for the dynamic creation of components
- A container process, which will be filled with the necessary components, based on yml configuration.
