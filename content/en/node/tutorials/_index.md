### [Data Microservice](data_microservice)

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll be writing from scratch a fully-functional Data microservice, using the patterns and mechanisms available in the Pip.Services toolkit, as well as the programming language you have selected. The microservice that we are going to be using as an example in this tutorial is called The Beacons microservice, which is part of The IoT Microservices Collection.
