### Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a persistence component, which will store some objects in memory. Then, we will see how to perform CRUD operations, such as adding data, reading it, updating stored values and deleting them. We will use a dummy object, which has the characteristic of being identifiable via an id parameter. All concepts learned here can be expanded to other more complex objects.
