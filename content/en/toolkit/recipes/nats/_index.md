### Key takeaways

### Introduction

This tutorial will help you understand how the NatsMessageQueue component is used. First, we will see a brief description of this class and how to import it. Then, we will implement this component, connect it, and create and send a message to a NATS server from it. Finally, we will combine the code into a complete program and summarize what we have learned.

### The NatsMessageQueue component

#### Pre-requisites

#### Implementing our component

#### Connecting to NATS

#### Creating and sending a message

#### Receiving a message

#### Final code

Now, we can combine the code from the previous sections into a program that creates an instance of this class, configures and connects it to our NATS server, and sends and receives a message from it. The code below shows the result of this operation:


### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the NatsMessageQueue component. First, we saw the necessary pre-requisites and how to create a configured instance of it. Then, we understood how to send and receive messages from our NATS server.  And lastly, we combined the different sections into one comprehensive program.
