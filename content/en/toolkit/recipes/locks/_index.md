### Key takeaways

### Introduction

### The MemoryLock component

### The NullLock component

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the MemoryLock and NullLock components. First, we saw that the first component allows us to create a lock that can be used to synchronize the execution of a process using shared memory. Then, we saw how to create, acquire, and release this kind of lock and an example of how to apply this component.

Finally, we learned that the NullLock is a dummy component that only simulates the behavior of a lock. Thus, we replaced the MemoryLock in the previous example with a NullLock and saw that the main difference is that the latter doesnâ€™t affect the execution of the program.
