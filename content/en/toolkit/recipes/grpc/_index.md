### Key takeaways

### Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a gRPC client and server by using the Pip.Servicesâ€™ gRPC module. We will start with an explanation of how to install this module and a brief description of the example used. Next, we will see how to create a gRPC server and client. Lastly, we will have a section containing the complete code for this project.

### Pre-requisites

### A brief overview of the example

### Proto file

### Server

### Client

### Final code

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a gRPC server and client. We also saw how to create a proto file and generate the two gRPC files via the protoc compiler. Finally, we understood how to run the server and the client and obtain a result from a call to the sum() method.
