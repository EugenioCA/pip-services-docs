### Wrapping up

This tutorial taught us how to create distributed caches and locks using a Memcached store. First, we learned how to define our cache and perform CRUD operations on records stored in our cache. Then, we created a distributed lock and saw how to manage it. We finished the explanations with an example that showed how to practically use a MemcachedLock with a processing task.
