### Key takeaways

### Introduction

A REST client is a program used to communicate with a service via the HTTP/REST protocol. Within Pip.Services, the RestClient component can be used as a base to build REST clients.

In this tutorial, you will be introduced to the RestClient component. First, we will see how to create a REST service by using the RestService class. Then, we will learn how to create a REST client with a class that extends the RestClient component. Following this, we will understand how to use the different HTML methods to communicate between the client and the service. We will end by reviewing what we learned in the different sections.

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a REST client that communicates via an endpoint defined by a REST service. We used the RestClient and the RestService classes to define these components, and we added functions for the GET, HEAD, POST and PUT methods in the service and the client. We concluded by creating a program that summarizes all the learned concepts.
