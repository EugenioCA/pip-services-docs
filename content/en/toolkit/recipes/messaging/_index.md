#### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the MemoryMessageQueue, which, as the name suggests, works on memory and can be used within a process. 
In order to understand the dynamics of this component, we created a message receiver and a listener for the queue. Then, we sent a message and saw that it was received by our queue. Finally, we summarized all the concepts into a single program.
