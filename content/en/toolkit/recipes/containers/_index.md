### Key takeaways

### Introduction

### The ProcessContainer container

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a ProcessContainer. This component allows us to run our code as a system process. 

First, we created a custom component that is openable and configurable. Then, we created a factory to create this component via the container and a configuration file used by the container to locate the different components. Finally, we created the container, run it, and obtained an output on our console showing the creation, configuration and opening of our component.

The example in this tutorial used a custom component. The same procedure applies to the containerization of any other component or set of components.
