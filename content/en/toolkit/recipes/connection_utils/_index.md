### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have seen how to use a set of utilities offered in the Component module that facilitate the programming of connections. 

We learned that these utilities help us to compose a URI from a set of parameters stored in a ConfigParams object, merge two sets of configuration parameters, filter a ConfigParams object, and decompose a URI string.

In the end, we saw an example that illustrated the practical use of some of these utilities.
