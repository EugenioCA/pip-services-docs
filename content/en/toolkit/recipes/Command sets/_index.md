### Key takeaways

### Introduction

The CommandSet component allows us to group a set of commands and events, which can be called and executed at a later stage. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a CommandSet component, add commands and events to it, and perform some operations, such as executing or finding a specific command from a command set.

In order to do this, we divide the work into two sections: the first explains how to operate with commands and the second how to work with events in a CommandSet.

### Using a CommandSet with Commands

#### Defining a CommandSet

#### Adding a command

#### Adding several commands at once

#### Executing a command

#### Getting all commands

### Using a CommandSet with Events

#### Adding an event

#### Adding several events at once

#### Adding a listener

#### Finding an event

#### Getting all the events

### Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have seen how to create a CommandSet that contains commands and events. We have also seen how to extract and use those commands and events and perform some operations with them.
